It will add some functions to make canvas's API more powerful.\r\n\r\nThis project contains two parts: \r\n\r\n* The first part is a series a javascript files, each one will contain a method that canvas's API doesn't included. Each method of the first part will be showed as a function, so it will be easier for developers to read and understand.\r\n* The second part is only one javascript file, it will be written as a IIFE, the function will excuted by itself as soon as it is download by the browser. It will return a subject which contain all the methods that implemented in the first part. When you want to add a certain method to extend the canvas's API, you can excute the function from the subject which is returned from the IIFE. And also, the subject also include a method to add all the functions to canvas's API. PS: the file is named CE.js.\r\n\r\n## The usage of the CE.js is as follows:\r\n\r\n### 1、The usage in your page.\r\nYou can use the CE.js just include the following line code in your html file.\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<script rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"EC.js\"></script>\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen the IIFE is excuted, it will add a \"CE\" to the window, so you can get all the functions provided by the CE.js.\r\n\r\n### 2、Add a certain method to canvas's API\r\n\r\nThe following codes will add a certain method to canvas's API.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nCE.functionName();\r\n```\r\n\r\n### 3、Add all the method to canvas's API\r\n\r\nThe following codes will add all the methods contained in CE.js to canvas's API.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nCE.all();\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n## Something else\r\n\r\nSome methods may draw lessons from books、websites or blogs, if there is any problem, please concat me by E-mail```web.taox@gmail.com```.
